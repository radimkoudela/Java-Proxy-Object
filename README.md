Java-Proxy-Object
=================

Proxy objects are well-known from area of remote method invocation. Their application in "local computing" was inhibited mainly by lack of a good support for proxies in standard libraries. This concept deals with situations where java object fails to connect to remote services and rather deals with invocation locally followed by replication procedure when remote service connection is restored.
